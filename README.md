## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   JavaScript

### What I learned

-   Learned to plan accessiblity better at the beginning of the project to make sure it is included in the process.
-   How to offset navigation when there is a stick header so that the header doesn't cut off the content.

### Continued development

-   I will continue to make sure to prioritize accessiblity so that everyone can feel welcomed in any site/app I create.
-   I would like to build a full website with routes using vanilla JS.
